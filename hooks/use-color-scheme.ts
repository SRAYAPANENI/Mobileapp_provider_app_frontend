// Locked to light mode regardless of the device's system theme — matches
// the customer app's decision (most established apps do the same for
// launch rather than fully supporting dynamic dark mode). Every screen
// reads through this one hook, so this is the single place to change to
// flip that back on later. Typed as the wider union (not the literal
// 'light') so every existing `=== 'dark'` comparison across the app still
// type-checks instead of TypeScript flagging them as impossible.
export function useColorScheme(): 'light' | 'dark' {
